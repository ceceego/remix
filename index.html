            <h2 class="cdrama-title"> Irons Girls and Cdramas</h2>
            <p class="cdrama-text">
              During China's Cultural Revolution, a mid-1900s movement to preserve Chinese culture, the Iron Girls (image on the left) posters emerged to empower young women during political and social upheaval. Soon, stories and visuals of strong and hardworking women spread throughout China, combatting traditional gender roles. 

              <br><br>Chinese television dramas, also known as C-dramas (image on the right) first aired in 1958 and have become exponentially popular with a 5 billion dollar industry in the 21st century. 
              
              <br><br> What do the Irons Girls and C-dramas have in common?
              
              <br><br> They both utilize female aesthetics as their main form to draw in their audience, which is primarily young women. Both forms of media role forms aim to influence women's feminine identity. Women's “value” is defined. Irons girls are celebrated for physical labor and contribution to the state. In C-dramas women’s success falls in their romantic relationships. Women are encouraged to be diligent at work, and loyal to the nation, but ultimately marry and have children.
              
              <br><br> Additionally, they are both highly government-regulated. Iron Girls were born out of Chinese Communist Party Mao Zhedong’s ideological push for a collectivist society with gender equality within the labor force.  C-dramas have to meet the requirements of the Regulations for the Management of Television Drama Production Licenses meaning they must “maintain a correct political orientation” and may not produce “content which does not adhere to the state of the nation.”
              
              <br><br> Lastly, both struggle with fully embracing gender equality. Irons Girls challenged traditional femininity but was ultimately seen as a failure by many scholars as it did not live up to expectations to dismantle the patriarchy. C-dramas present strong female characters but their narratives are often softened with hyper-feminine traits and dependence on male protagonists. These aspects have been criticized by modern-day Chinese feminists.
              
              <br><br> Please join me in this scholarly debate about the successes and limitations of women’s empowerment, purpose in life, and more. There are two different ‘galleries’ that will introduce both historical and current criticisms and praises of women's representation in Chinese media. While engaging with this topic, please keep in mind to be culturally sensitive.
